      My web dev journey began as a hobby in early 2022. It quickly became my favorite pastime, and my interest only
      grew from there. Over the past two years, I've been actively improving my skills, both practically and
      theoretically, in both front-end and back-end programming. Getting acquainted with the ever-expanding potential of
      web development has been a welcome challenge.
